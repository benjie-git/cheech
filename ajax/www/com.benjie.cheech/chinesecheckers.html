<h1>Chinese Checkers</h1>

<h2>Rules:</h2>

The object of the game is to get all 10 of your pieces from your starting triangle
into the triangle opposite.  Players take turns moving one piece at a time.  On
each move you can:
<ul>
	<li/>move a piece to any adjacent position (which must be empty)
	<li/>hop a piece over an adjacent piece into the next position 
		in the same direction (which must be empty)
	<li/>chain together multiple hops
</ul>

<h2>Variations:</h2>
cheech currently supports 3 rule variations.
<ul>
	<li/><b>Long Jumps</b>: with this rule variation enabled, each hop can 
	be longer.  Normally, hops always move from one position, over an adjacent
	position to the next position in the same direction (which must be empty).
	With Long Jumps, you can hop from one position, over any number (0 or more)
	of empty positions, followed by a piece, followed by the same number of empty
	positions again, and into the next position (which must be empty).  Multiple 
	hops of different-lengths can be chained together in one move.

	<li/><b>Hopping Through Other Players' Triangles</b>: If this is disabled, 
		then you're not allowed to end a move in, or pass through any other player's
		starting or ending triangle.

	<li/><b>Stopping In Other Players' Triangles</b>: If this is disabled, 
		then you're not allowed to end a move in any other player's
		starting or ending triangle.
</ul>

is the same as cheech's 'Long Jumps' variation.)
