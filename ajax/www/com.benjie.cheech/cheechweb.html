<h1>cheechweb</h1>

<p>cheechweb is the web-based interface to 
<a href="http://cheech.sourceforge.net/">cheech</a>.<p/>

<p>Once everyone has joined into a game (for example if the game is set up for 3 
people, then once 3 people have joined), start playing!</p>

<p>You can also and add computer players into the game using the 
'Add Computer Player' menu items.  (Each item is a different computer player.)
Watch out, they're not super smart, but they are thorough!</p>

<p>To make a move, click on the peg you want to move, then on the empty hole to 
move your peg to.  If you're making a multiple-hop move, you need to click on 
each hole that you're hopping through along your chain of hops.  When you've
finished clicking out your hopping path, double click the last hole, or press 
Enter to make your move.</p>
