To compile GNet on MacOS X (and NeXT, OpenStep and other similar OS's)
you need to disable smart preprocessing.  To do this, instead of just
running configure run:

csh/tcsh:
  % setenv CFLAGS -traditional-cpp
  % ./configure

sh/bash:
  % CFLAGS=-traditional-cpp ./configure

(This may not be required in 10.1 and later version.)
