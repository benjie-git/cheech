Changes in GNet

2.0.8
-----
* New API:
  gnet_conn_set_main_context
  gnet_conn_http_set_main_context
  gnet_inetaddr_new_async_full
  gnet_inetaddr_new_list_async_full
  gnet_inetaddr_get_name_async_full
  gnet_tcp_socket_connect_async_full
  gnet_tcp_socket_new_async_full
  gnet_tcp_socket_new_async_direct_full
  gnet_unix_socket_new_abstract
  gnet_unix_socket_server_new_abstract
  gnet_uri_parse_inplace
* GConnHttp API is no longer marked as experimental
* Fix major memory leak in GConnHttp
* gnet_init() can now safely be called
  more than once now
* Fix crash when gnet_conn_http_delete()
  is called from within the user callback.
* GConnHttp: do not emit data events for
  pages that are being redirected to a
  new location.
* GConnHttp: add gnet_conn_http_set_escaped_uri()
  (Samuel Cormier-Iijima)
* Eliminate direct pthread usage on unix
  and use GLib GThreads instead (also
  fixes problems with gdb and valgrind)
  (Andreas Rottmann)
* Dropped support for GLib-1.2
* Fix build on old systems that have
  a __ss_family member in struct 
  sockaddr_storage instead of 
  ss_family (Jeremy Denise)
* GConnHttp: Documentation fixes
* Fix compilation with --enable-debug
  on some 64-bit architectures like
  amd64 (Daniel Gryniewicz)
* GConnHttp: fix several timeout issues
  (Steve Morris, Tim Muller).
* GConnHttp: fix parsing of POST method
  response when there are optional headers
  after the 100-Continue response (#459895).
* Relicense source code in examples/
  directory from GPL to LGPL.
* Add 'extern "C"' guards to pack.h to
  make things work with c++ compilers
  (thanks to Adriano Winter Bess).
* New API: gnet_conn_write_direct() to
  write buffers asynchroneously without
  copying them (Jeff Garzik)
* Fix for race condition and subsequent
  crash in asynchroneous DNS lookup
  (Steve Morris, Tim MÃ¼ller)
* Pass correct size parameters to bind()
  and connect() when creating unix sockets
  (Zeeshan Ali, #403197)
* New API: gnet_unix_socket_new_abstract()
  and gnet_unix_socket_server_new_abstract()
  add support for abstract unix sockets on
  systems where this is supported
  (Zeeshan Ali, #404583)
* Remove unused and pointless fork() fallback
  for asynchronous DNS lookups in cases where
  GLib has been compiled without threading
  support.  It's 2007 - I think it's in order
  to require threading to be present; even my
  wrist watch can do that.  Removs lots of
  unmaintained code and ugly #ifdefs.
(Released Feb 3, 2008)
